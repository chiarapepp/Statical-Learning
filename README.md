# Statical-Learning projects and final exam
This repository contains various assignments and projects completed during the Statistical Learning course at the University of Florence. The projects cover different topics, including Monte Carlo simulations, kernel regression, statistical analysis using machine learning models, and clustering techniques.

### Assignements 
1. Monte Carlo Simulation for Poker Hands Probabilities : 
In this project, Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the probabilities of different poker hands.

2. Kernel Regression on Synthetic and Real Data :
This project focuses on estimating a regression function using the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimator on both synthetic and real data. The goal was to model the functional relationship between variables and estimate the regression function.

3. Statistical Analysis of Key Variables in League of Legends : 
In this contest, we applied CART, Random Forest, and BART models to analyze key variables in League of Legends.

### Final Exam: DBSCAN Analysis
This final exam project involves an in-depth analysis of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), applied to both real and simulated datasets. The analysis includes a detailed description of the algorithm and its performance on various data types.

Folders:
Presentations: Contains slides and presentations for each assignment.
Final Exam: Contains the code and analysis related to the DBSCAN final exam project.
