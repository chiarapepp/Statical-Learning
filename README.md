# Statical-Learning projects and final exam
This repository contains various assignments and projects completed during the Statistical Learning course at the University of Florence. The projects cover different topics, including Monte Carlo simulations, kernel regression, statistical analysis using machine learning models, and clustering techniques.

### Assignements 
1. Homework 1 : 
In this project, Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the probabilities of different poker hands.

2. Homework 2 :
This project focuses on estimating a regression function using the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimator on both synthetic and real data. The goal was to model the functional relationship between variables and estimate the regression function.

3. Contest : 
CART, Random Forest, and BART models were applied to analyze key variables in League of Legends.

### Final Exam: DBSCAN Analysis
This final exam project involves an in-depth analysis of DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), applied to both real and simulated datasets. The analysis includes a detailed description of the algorithm and its performance on various data types.
